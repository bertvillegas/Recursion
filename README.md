# Recursion
A few small recursive projects

Problem 1 (Digit Sum)
Write a recursive function to sum the digits in the given number.
For example if n is 1234, then 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, so return 10
Hint: the % operator (aka, modulus) is useful for extracting a single digit.

Problem 2 (List Max)
Given a list of numbers return the max value in the list.
Your solution should use recursion and return None if lst is empty

Problem 3 (Staircase Paths)
You're climbing a staircase with n stairs. With each step you can
climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs. How many distinct ways can you
climb to the top of the staircase?

For example, consider a 4 stair staircase. These are all the ways
to reach the top:
1. 1 step, 1 step, 1 step, 1 step
2. 1 step, 1 step, 2 step
3. 1 step 2 step, 1 step
4. 2 step, 1 step, 1 step
5. 2 step, 2 step
Therefore, staircase_paths(4) == 5, since there are 5 distinct ways
to reach the top of 4 stairs.

By default a staircase with 0 stairs has 1 way to climb it.
